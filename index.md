Welcome to the ASHE 2023 workshop, _A Gentle Introduction to Bayesian Analysis
with Applications to QuantCrit_. This workshop will introduce
quantitatively-trained researchers to the Bayesian paradigm. Participants will
learn through short lecture and by implementing short example problems that
focus on the unique benefits of Bayesian analysis in QuantCrit frameworks,
particularly as applicable for small group inference and more readily
interpretable estimates across impacted audiences.

Before the workshop, please follow the instructions on the 
[setup page]( {{ site.baseurl }}/setup/) page to install the necessary software.

# Tentative Schedule

## 1. Theoretical underpinnings

_This section will introduce the concepts behind Bayesian inference.
Facilitators will lead discussion using slides with opportunity for participant
questions and comments._

Time: ~30-35 min 

**Topics**

1. **Conditional probability / Bayes Theorem**  
_Description:_ We will quickly derive Bayes Theorem from the decomposition of
joint probability into conditional probabilities (3 lines of math. . . we
promise!), focusing mostly on intuition. This is a very short bit of math that
should be straightforward to those with regression training, but is easy to
follow regardless.
2. **Priors, likelihoods, posteriors**  
_Description:_ We will discuss the three key components of a Bayesian analysis ---
priors, likelihoods, and posteriors --- in terms of their respective mathematical
and conceptual meanings in Bayesian inference.
3. **Interpretation**  
_Description:_ We will examine the key differences between Bayesian and
frequentist output (parameters are random compared to data are random). Again,
the discussion will be high level and mostly focused on how Bayesian results
come as full distributions instead of point estimates with standard errors.

## 2. Example analysis

_This section will guide participants through a hands-on data analysis,
following the facilitatorâ€™s demonstration on their own computers. Code and data
will be provided through this website created for the workshop. Extra facilitators
will move throughout the room to help participants with technical issues that
may arise. Work will follow the I do / we do / you do strategy and allow
participants the opportunity to both work on their own computers and with each
other._

Time: ~2 hours 30 min (including time for a short break)

**Topics**

For this analysis example, we will use publicly available data relevant to
higher education. The plan will be to use a reduced version of the High School
Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS09) to perform increasingly complex regression
analyses. We will perform various model checks and ways of presenting the
results. Throughout, we will attend to the ways Bayesian analyses can support a
critical approach to quantitative work.

## 3. Applications
_This section will be primarily discussion based._

Time: ~15 min

**Topics**

As motivated by the example analyses, we will close the session by covering
potential use cases for Bayesian analyses that make them preferable over
frequentist methods in some situations. The idea is that these will be discussed
during the examples, but we will conclude by reiterating these points as well as
opening up the room for questions and discussion. In particular, we will focus
on the promise that Bayesian analyses have in supporting QuantCrit analytic
frameworks:

1. Ability to provide estimates using small data sets
2. Ability to provide estimates for small groups that otherwise might be dropped or aggregated
3. Provide estimates that are more easily interpretable by stakeholders, data
owners, and participants with the purpose of supporting actionable, antiracist,
social justice-oriented policy
