Now that we've finished our working examples, here are some questions for
discussion. We may have already considered some of them, but we may want to
examine them further. These are in no particular order:

1. What are some promises of Bayesian approaches in quantitative educational
   research, both overall and in connection to QuantCrit and other critical
   work?
1. What are some difficulties?
   1. Technological?
   1. Social (_e.g._, publication, citation)?
   1. For critical work?
1. What are some applications you can think of right now?
1. What would it take for Bayesian approaches to find more widespread use in
   educational research?
