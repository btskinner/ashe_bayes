Here are some resources you might find useful for learning more about Bayesian
statistics. This list is by no means comprehensive, but hopefully will be
useful. As a shameless plug, ee've also included a couple of articles that
attempt to combine Bayesian analyses and critical frameworks.

## Books

- McElreath, R. (2018). _Statistical rethinking: A Bayesian course with examples
  in R and Stan._ Chapman and Hall/CRC.
- Gelman, A., Carlin, J. B., Stern, H. S., Dunson, D. B., Vehtari, A., and Rubin,
  D. B. (2014). _Bayesian Data Analysis_. CRC Press, 3rd edition.

## Software

### R

- [Stan](https://mc-stan.org): A modern statistical programming language for
  performing Bayesian analyses
- [brms](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/): An R package for Bayesian
  modeling based on the lme4 syntax that uses Stan under the hood
- [ShinyStan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/shinystan): Interactive tool
  for the inspection of Bayesian models

### Python

- [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html): An alternative to Stan that works in Python

## Visualizations

- [The Markov-chain Monte Carlo Interactive
  Gallery](http://chi-feng.github.io/mcmc-demo/): A cool interactive website
  that visualizes different MCMC samplers
